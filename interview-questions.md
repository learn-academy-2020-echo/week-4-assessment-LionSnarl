# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. Are Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer: Methods in Ruby are simply accessing data, however there are methods that do set and get values (called setter & getter methods).

  Researched answer: Ruby has getter methods that access data of an instance variable and Ruby has setter methods that actually set the data's value of an instance variable, all of which are accessing and mutating the specific data of a single instance variable.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Blocks in Ruby are pieces of code that are passed to a method to be used and can be called upon inside a method after being called. They are basically instructions for what you're trying to do.

  Researched answer: Ruby has the ability to use these 'chunks of code' called blocks to be used by methods, so you can use that block within ({braces}) to be executed where ever its called.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return is the implied notion that whatever function present, it is executing directly after the outcome of said function; without having to specific call a 'return' for that function. So, instead of having to declare a functions end, it will automatically return on the next line of code.

  Researched answer: So, knowing Ruby has implicit return, I am able to build a function and have it return the last evaluated expression without explicitly declaring for a return.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: object-oriented programming is designing your data into structures you can use called objects where you are able to create certain behaviors and call upon properties within these objects to achieve a specific output. Functional programming is focused on using functions to manipulate data to always achieve a specific output.
  I've heard OOP & Functional programming be compared to Cake Recipes. You can use a recipe to make as many cakes as you want, them all being separate. However, you can also use that existing recipe and add your own additions to make a cake that is based off the last one.

  Researched answer: Object-Oriented Programming is dynamic and highly abstract, being allowed to create innumerable specific objects through classes, where as functional programming is exact and is programed task after task to achieve a desired output, so data can only be transformed by creating functions.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is stating what parameters/framework objects are able to contain, verses an object itself can only hold one instance of properties at a single time.

  Researched answer: An object is an instance of a class, or else an object is explicitly created and defined. Whereas, classes are templates for creating objects; they hold the properties/behaviors and define a default value that an object should possess.



6. STRETCH: What is Duck Typing?

  Your answer: If your program is able to say that "said input is a duck" by examining through the "walks like a duck, talks like a duck.." philosophy, you're said to be duck typing.. meaning you're way of getting a desired output is not as important as if its already able to be used for use in a multitude of methods.

  Researched answer: Within Duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of the right methods and properties, rather than if if the object is the correct type.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- PostgreSQL- An open source relational database that enables users to have access to a database.
- API- An API is a Application Programming Interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications.
- CRUD-Create, Read, Update, and Delete stand for CRUD and its an acronym for the necessary requirements for a persistent storage application. They are the four basic functions needed to have slightly permanent data storage.
- Ruby on Rails- or Rails, is a server-side web application written in Ruby. It uses a Model-View_controller framework which provides structures for a dattabase, a web service, and web pages.
- ORM- Object-Relational Mapping, or ORM, is a programming technique that is used for converting data between incompatible type systems using Object-Oriented Programming langauges. The problem trying to be fixed is translating the logical representation of data from one form of type system to the next form of type system.
- Active Record- It's the model Ruby uses which is a layer of the system responsible for representing data and logic. Active Record creates and uses objects whose data require persistent storage to a database.
